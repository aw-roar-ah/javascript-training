# javascript-training
#class-1 : 
 - to run javascript file from CLI: node <filename> from folder path CMD
 - Without or with semicolon, both will work.
 - in js, execution and compilation happens when we run the code
 - by default, the value for any integer variable will be undefined

 **Variables:**
 ---------------------
- Always start with the characters {_ and $} (no numbers)


**Data Types:** 
-----------------------
1. Primitive Data types: number, string, boolean, null, undefined
2. Non- primitive data types: arrays, functions, object

**Unary Operators**
------------------------
+, -, ++, --, !

**Equality Operator**
---------------------------

== : always compares only value
!= : not equal
=== : compare not only values but data types also
<= : lessthan or equal to : >= greater than equal to

**Logical operator**
-------------------------

Logical AND - true && true ---true, in all other cases it is false
Logical OR - false||false ---false, in all other cases it is true


**User Defined Functions**
---------------------------------

- keyword "function" is used. 


function Login(){
<code goes here for login>

}
- return statement should always be in the end
- you can't return more than one value in js
- you can do any arithmetic operation and directly return 


*Arrow Function*
Arrow function is a function without name, without function keyword and without return keyword. 

*Anonymous Function*
Function without a name

## Difference between var, let and const

- A file or a folder -> we call it module.
- Al forLoop or condition -> Block

> If you define any variable as VAR : scope of variable is throughout the module.
> If you define a variable as Let: scope is limited to block only.
>If you define a variable as const: it can't be modified anywhere and scope will be limited to block. 


**Class and Objects**
------------------------------------

Class- Class is a collection of attributes and methods

 ```python
 In javascript, we can't have multiple constructor in a class. || In other languages, we have that.
 ```

'this' keyword refers to the current object
